					<p>Joanne Brown has saved my life!  After my husband died in a motorcycle accident 6 years ago, my life went into a free fall...emotionally and financially.  I had only been running my own law office for 2 1/2 years when it happened, and REALLY NEEDED my husband's income to pay most of the bills.  As a result of this loss, I made mistakes, and got into HUGE tax debt.  I have been paying down that debt in installments, and it's been like a ball and chains.  This year, I hired an accountant to do my 2017 tax return.  Because it was so complicated, we got an extension to file it in October.  When I went to his office to pick up the return, I was HORRIFIED at how much he said I owed in taxes!  I was thinking that I was going to have to sell my house to pay it off.  Then I looked into something I saw about Daily Money Managers, and chose Joanne.  I just wanted her to straighten out my finances for me.  I was willing to accept my tax debt, and just deal with it.  But Joanne convinced me to let her take a look at my tax return and other information.  Well, as it turns out, she figured out that my accountant really messed up!  He attributed over $100,000 to me that was not actually even my income (long story)!  She worked with him to straighten things out, and now I owe FAR less to the IRS than anticipated.  Now she's looking at my tax returns for previous years to see if mistakes were made.  Joanne has also worked with me to get my bills paid on time, and to establish a manageable budget.  These are things that I've never been good at.  For the past 6 years, I lost sleep at night worrying about my bills.  Now I don't worry anymore.  Joanne is kind and compassionate, and REALLY wants to help people who have gotten into difficult financial positions.  I would recommend her to ANYONE!</p>

						<p>My husband had always handled the finances in our house, so when he became unable to do so, I was at a loss. Joanne explained the options I had, and made me feel comfortable with my choices. I also believe she eased the burden on my adult children by handling the finances while they were occupied with the healthcare decisions we faced together. I can recommend her without reservation. </p>

											<h3>Do you or a family member find that your financial affairs are not as organized as you would like, or are taking up too much of your time?</h3>
											<p>As a daily money manager, I can take care of the financial paperwork and day-to-day bill payments for clients who are either unable to do it themselves, or who simply wish to spend their time focusing on their family or career. I can also offer clients help creating a budget, so they are able to take control of their finances. My career in business was as a financial controller, where I was responsible for ensuring that all business financial transactions were correctly made and documented. This, along with being a long-time small business owner, provides the expertise needed to act as a personal bookkeeper and assistant in managing your financial needs. In addition to providing help for those that need assistance to manage their daily financial affairs, Brown Personal Money Management Services is also able to provide help for small business owners with setting up and maintaining their bookkeeping needs.</p>
											<p>As a member of the American Association of Daily Money Managers, I adhere to their code of ethics and am fully insured.</p>

																<h3>Need Help Managing Day-to-Day Finances?</h3>
															</header>
															<p>A daily money manager might fit the bill. Imagine having someone who makes sure your bills are paid on time, organizes your tax documents and hands them off to your accountant, and even follows up with your insurance company because you were supposed to be reimbursed for physical therapy.It turns out, you don't have to be wealthy to hire a trusted professional to take care of these kitchen-table money issues for you. Engaging a daily money manager (also known as a DMM) can be a cost-effective way of making sure your financial life is in order.</p>

															<p>Eighty-year-old Norma McNeal is a Parkinson's sufferer, an avid reader and a political junkie. So the last thing she needs to worry about is whether her utility bill is paid on time or whether she has enough money in her bank account to get through the month. "How could I keep track of things when I can't even sign my own name?" she asks.</br>
															Think of a DMM as a personal financial assistant — a professional or volunteer who can sort through the mail, pay the bills, balance the checkbook and help maintain a budget. A DMM will even monitor bank statements to make sure no one — such as a home health-care provider — is dipping into the client's funds.</p>
