											<h2>About Me</h2>
											<p>As a daily money manager, I can take care of the financial paperwork and day-to-day bill payments for clients who are either unable to do it themselves, or who simply wish to spend their time focusing on their family or career. I can also offer clients help creating a budget so that theyâ€™re able to take control of their finances. My career in business as a financial controller, where I was responsible to ensure that all financial transactions were correctly made and documented, and also a business owner makes me well qualified to act as a personal bookkeeper and personal assistant combined. After years in the business sector, I decided I wanted to change to a more rewarding job where I could make a direct difference in people's lives. When the need arose for me to handle the financial paperwork for a family member, I realized that this would be an ideal way for me to help others in the same position. Not everyone has a family member that is able to step in to take over their daily financial tasks, whether because of location, ability, or lack of time. That is where I can help, providing clients with the business and social support needed to manage their monetary matters, assembling the necessary documents for tax returns, and acting as a liaison with other professionals, such as lawyers, financial advisors, and accountants. I live in Waxhaw, NC with my husband, 3 dogs, cat, and 2 horses. I have 2 adult daughters, one a web designer living in Cary, NC, the other a PhD student at Oxford University, England. </p>
